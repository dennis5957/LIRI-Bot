# Liri.js

Liri was created to give quick access to the information you **love**.

1. Twitter
    - Get the 20 most recent tweets from you and those you follow
2. Spotify
    - Get detailed information about any song you choose
3. OMDb
    - Get the details for your favorite movies (includes movies with similar titles)

## Example

### Command Line Usage

```javascript
    node liri.js spotify-this-song "November Rain"
    node liri.js my-tweets
    node liri.js movie-this "Die Hard"

    //Advanced - reads command from external file (random.txt)
    node liri.js do-what-it-says
```

## Contributions

If Liri had a **GUI** it would be ~~sort of~~ useful. Clone Liri and make it happen!
